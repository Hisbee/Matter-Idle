		desc:Most common around shorelines and ponds, Stickish are fish that have fused with sticks in the water. This has made them incredibly good at floating around and... that's it really. Not really that useful </> </> <b>Effects:</b> <.> Increase Matter production by 0.5 </> </> <b>Fun Facts:</b> <.> Stickish were used in tool handles, but where found to be kinda useless <.> These guys suck

		desc:Most common around shorelines and ponds, Peblens have evolved to be part fish, part rock to help with surviving predators, helping both to blend in as well as making it very tough to bite down on. It's skin can be smelted with iron to make a light, bendable but strong alloy </> </> <b>Effects:</b> <.> Increase Matter production by 0.5 </> </> <b>Fun Facts:</b> <.> The Peblen's most common predator is the Blugill, as its long, sharp tooth can easily pierce though their tough skin. <.> It's eyes can be taken out and eaten. Why this is is currently unknown, thought some researchers think it could be a consequence of evolving such hard skin. They also taste like Gum Drops. <.> Weirdly enough, these fish have no relation to Stonefish, and are not poisonous to touch.

		desc:Most common in shallow oceans, Dustcarp are a pest that are neither carp nor what they emit dust. It's actually Asbestos. These are considered a Tier-I pest and must be killed on sight if doing so wouldn't endanger you are anyone nearby. Luckily due to the whole emitting Asbestos deal they are quite useful for most things Asbestos are used for such as, Fire Proofing, Cooking Oil and Thermal Insulation </> </> <b>Effects:</b> <.> Increase Matter production of Tier I Matter Makers by 30% </> </> <b>Fun Facts:</b> <.> If your wondering why Dustcarp aren't call something like "AsbestosNotACarp", these were found and named in 1927 <.> To keep Dustcarp, like most pest fish, you need a special license <.> Dustcarp were sold as pets in 1941, "coincidentally" rates of Mesothelioma went up by around 36% as well <.> Dustcarp have near human like cooperation skills

		desc:Most common in deeper oceans, JellyCans are living blobs of Jell-O born from humans littering. These are considered a Tier-O pest and should be killed if you are able to. They pose no harm to other sea life, but are well known for cutting the ropes of fishing nets. They also taste really nice, leading for them to fetch high prices on the market. One of the most famous dishes made with JellyCans are Château de gelée Miam Miam, not made in France nor made by a French man, the original creator, who we shall not name, was just a prickhead, is made by piling a hill of JellyCan goop, spray painted different colours, with a few Peblen eyes (also spray painted different colors) spread throughout. </> </> <b>Effects:</b> <.> Increase Matter production by 7% </> </> <b>Fun Facts:</b> <.> <.> <.>
